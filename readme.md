## Mail Routes Application


## Project
  This project was a "I can do it better my self approach".
  When I was a postman, it was frustrating that no address was in order in the app we had.

  My first thought, was that you only need the addresses that you have package to,
  so I added a "add address" input.

  My second thought, was that I wanted to get the hole route for any new member for the team.
  So I added all the routes, when clicked on the routes on side.
  This is done by fetching the data from node server and filter to my needs.

  I wrote to route myself, but in the format they already use.
  Notice: Not any route has an actual route, when clicked.
  This is not a mistake, simply just to save time.


## Futher Project
  I want to add a google map that can tell the route from each location.
  And skip an address, if it isn't necessary.
